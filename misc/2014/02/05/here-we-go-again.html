    <p>I made my first foray into this with Blogger and Blogspot back in 2001. I was a newly minted Business Analyst that, hindsight being what it is, wouldn’t know a requiremnt if it hit him in the head. Regardless, all things tech were cool, and blogging, after years of manually updating static HTML pages, was the latest and greatest thing. 2001 was a big year though. 9/11 was followed 6 days later by the birth of my daughter. In addition to talking about blogging, I had a lot of joy to share and angry politics to spew. Ah, the arrogance of youth. So important.</p>

<p>A problem though was that I didn’t really enjoy writing that much. After the initial excitement of the new platform and the emotion of those two events wore off, I didn’t have much to say. New in my career, I had no expertise that I felt was worth sharing, and the random trivialities of daily life didn’t seem worth the effort. I did like to tinker though so I quickly moved on to the more customizable, open system that was MoveableType at the time. Then Wordpress. Now Jekyll and Octopress.</p>

<p>Goals for 2014 including more writing, way more reading, and a whole lot less TV. This site should be a consistent outlet for that. We’ll see how it goes. I’m at a point in my career where I feel like I have some expertise worth sharing, I know the workings of most platforms to the extent that I need to know them and can thus just let them be without tinkering (or breaking!), and the birth of my second daughter is just around the corner. There’s a certain full-circle feel to this.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to do around here to clean things up and get them customized though so I guess there’s still tinkering to do. For now, everything is running on a mostly uncustomized version of Octopress with the Octostrap3 theme serving up pretty generic Bootstrap 3. All of that proved pretty trivial to setup and get going once you get comfortable with Ruby and the various Gem dependencies. Reading the Octopress Setup page carefully got me going in less than an hour. Subsequent theme installation and testing took another hour more.</p>
