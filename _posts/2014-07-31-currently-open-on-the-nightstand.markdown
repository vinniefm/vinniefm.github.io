*Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience* – Jeff Gothelf

Skimming through this again as we bring on a new team member that doesn’t have much Agile team experience. Once you get in the mindset that artifacts don’t matter unless they’re being developed to create shared understanding across the team, getting hit with questions derived from less lean processes is shocking. Going back to this as a reference has helped verbalize and connect the problems of the old world with the solutions of the new.

If you’re involved with UX/UCD or Agile/Lean processes in any way and you haven’t read this, put down what you’re doing right now and order it.

*The Birth Partner: A Complete Guide to Childbirth for Dads, Doulas, and All Other Labor Companions* – Penny Simkin

I was eager to crack this one open and I think for a first timer it has a lot of great content to mull over prior to labor and even to keep with you as reference during labor. Having done it once already, I’m finding it to be a good skim and refresher but I’m more looking forward to the labor class we have scheduled later this month. I know the moving parts and the general process (this book gives you that), so the team building aspect of the class should prove more valuable.

*Logical Chess: Move By Move, Every Move Explained* – Irving Chernev

Awesome read from the first page. I’ve played chess casually since I was a kid but never thought much of it until recent conversations with a friend. My completely lame ranking that I started out with on Chess.com (~650) got an immediate 200 point boost by implementing tactics based on Chernev’s commentary on the first game’s opening moves. Get ready to multi-task when reading this though. At least for me, I must have a board present to better visualize the patterns presented and the flow of the game.

*Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets* – Nassim Taleb

Taleb’s material is dense. Everytime I pick it up I make a new connection between concepts and patterns I’m already working with, or have an epiphany about something wholly new. That said, I rarely get through more than a handful of pages before I’m Googling about tangents spurred by the material. Slow going. We’ll see how it progresses.
