Came across a number of presentations by Paul Hibbitts today while doing research of my own for a presentation on the UX/Product Design process for a newly forming team at Echo.

Particularly well done were:

   * <a href="http://slid.es/paulhibbitts/cmpt-363-133-the-process-of-ixd-design">The Process of IxD</a>
   * <a href="http://slid.es/paulhibbitts/cmpt-363-133-introduction-to-user-experience-design">Intro to UX Design</a> (more of a 101 course)
