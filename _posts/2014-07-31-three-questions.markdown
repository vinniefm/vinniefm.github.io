Primarily functioning as a UX team of one over the last 18 months at an organization having not previously invested in UX, I've spent a good amount of time in my current role answering a seemingly simple question, "What is UX?" <a href="#" class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Tone should be conversational and can convey irony given technical savvy or the target audience." title="" data-original-title="Tone">We all know, however, that it is not that simple</a>. There are many "right" answers but for purposes of this discussion, the term Human Computer Interface (HCI), <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&q=HCI,+ux,+ucd,+product+design,+saas+design&cmpt=q&content=1" target="_blank">while discussed less often in recent years</a>, can help us understand the complexity. Simply put, imperfect and buggy as a given application may be, they can generally be described as precise, logical machines. They mostly behave in predictable ways. When they do not, we consider them broken and and attempt to fix them. Humans, as we know, are often not logical or predictable. They are highly variable and seemingly illogical. Individual and group behaviors and goals may even contradict and conflict with each other over periods of time. We're a messy lot. 

But it is the human side of the equation that we seek to understand in order to build a given interface as logically and precisely as possible. It is by building that understanding in a structured, evolutionary way such that the team is empowered to iteratively design and deliver solutions that solve for the problems, wants, needs, motivations, desires of the user within the constraint parameters set by the business sponsor (e.g. resource cost, time, etc.), and the feasibility assesment performed by architecture. 

While the larger blog that has grown from this writing effort will seek to document the various nuances of my answer to the question, "What is UX?", this post will focus on these three questions: 

1. What are the design considerations when building Products/SaaS applications?
2. What are the differences between UX and UI design?
3. What are some good examples of product design, including my own work? 

## Design Considerations in Product/SaaS Application Development

## Differences Between UX and UI Design

### What is UX Design?

In this context, the definition of UX is fairly straightforward. It is the undertanding that while a proposed solution has been designed to solve a specific problem, that solution must also function within the larger parent system and the constraints inherent therein. Simultaneously strategic and tactical, UX Design seeks to insure consistently usable and useful functions are delivered to the user where the usefulness and usability is [researched|analyzed|judged] [from|at] the level of the smallest component (e.g. typography, a checkbox, etc) up the stack through synthetic components spanning across multi-page workflows. That then naturally leads to the integration the system's various workflows into an chohesive application. Additionally, by that definition, UX Design should be viewed more as a multi-disciplinary function than a distinct role. 

To be effective, contributors to this function must constantly work to align their goals to work towards creating a framework that:

* Is informed by an ever deepening knowledge of the user and the tasks that they desire to complete. By doing so, we increase our understanding of what features will be seen as useful. UX represents the user, a 
* Facilitates the generation of a consistent language by which a commonly understood design vocabulary can emerge
* Encourages re-use and other principles of object oriented design to both reduce system development and maintenance costs and, more importantly, provide the user with a consistent and predictable interface that reduces cognitive processing in terms of executing the interactions provided and in turn focus more on the task and value which its successful execution provides     

Numerous diagrams have been produced in order to illustrate this notion. I personally prefer the views represented in the "Spectrum of User Experience" by InformationArchitects.jp to be informative:

#### What is UI Design?

If we agree that UX is a multi-disciplinary function then it follows that UI Design is one of the critical roles contributing to the quality of the user's experience. UI design practioners, working with the knowledge, precedent, and constraint provided by the broader UX framework, typically solve problems using tools well known to Visual and Interaction Designers, Information Architects, 

Even here though there is a potential split in the defintion worth noting. It is likely that most people, when asking this question, are thinking about issues related to visual and interaction design (what is on the "glass"), and that, given the background of the questioner I most often experience, typically offers the best approach to answering the question. With the increasing maturity of robust frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation it should also be considered that the "UI Designer" could be an engineer designing a user intrface system generated in part from a live style guide and managed through well understood versioning repositories and build systems.
