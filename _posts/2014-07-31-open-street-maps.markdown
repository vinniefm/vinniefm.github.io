Brief history on the <a href="http://stevecoast.com/2014/01/30/its-time-to-make-openstreetmap-your-only-street-map/">Open Stree Map (OSM) project</a> and good thoughts on why itâ€™s important. Maps are important and their ownership is too. Happy to say that I'm involved in the early stages of design and implementation of an OSM project and thus far, our first prototype app has been a sucess. More to come.
