Nor does <a href="http://toomanyideas.net/2013/i-dont-like-datagrids.html">toomanyideas.net</a>. Everytime I've come across a grid solution like Telrik and the like (jqGrid is another offendar), my first thought is to question whether we need such an over-engineered, "make it work like Excel", solution. I have yet to come across a case where it's necessary. Implementation pain and questions of extension aside, the UX, in cases where you don't actually need Excel, sucks because you're presenting the user with an Excel experience when something different would be optimal. A hammer to drive a screw. It *could* work, but it's a crutch for the lazy in every case I've seen from information consumption to data entry.
