Well, it's obviously been slow going as evidenced by the lack of
commitment on display with nothing said since February. Having a kid
will do that I guess. I've also had the pleasure recently of spending
more time with my 12 year old daughter. We've been working through the
HTML/CSS Code Academy class, which has been a lot of fun!

I am also happy to report that significant progress has been made
towards posting some portfolio work along with local HTML and PDF
versions of my resume. Links coming soon.
