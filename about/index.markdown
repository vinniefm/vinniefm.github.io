              <p><img src="../images/headshot2.jpg" class="headshot" />My name is Vince Mease. I&rsquo;m a UX professional living and working in Chicago, IL. My efforts are currently focused on designing inside sales and operations management applications supporting the Echo Global Logistics sales force.</p>

              <p>I&rsquo;m interested in issues surrounding usability research,
              information architecture, interaction design, and workflow
              optimization. Much of my career has been spent solving problems in
              custom enterprise and SaaS application environments but I&rsquo;ve
              gotten my toes more than a little wet in consumer facing eCommerce
              and content sites as well. I champion the cause of the end user
              and have extensive experience using lean UX and user centered
              design (UCD) tools to responsively solve problems in mobile and desktop environments.</p>

              <p>I had the pleasure of being exposed to a <em>disciplined</em> Agile/Scrum transition a few years ago. Once you see it done well, there&rsquo;s no going back. I&rsquo;ve picked up a fair amount of coaching experience since then and absolutely love seeing teams go from being marginal producers to high morale, high performance teams delivering value on a regular, predictable basis. In my mind, delivering a successful Scrum transition in IT to the rest of the organization is simply &ldquo;organizational UX&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all &ldquo;systems design&rdquo; with the broader business as the user.</p>

              <p>Beyond that, I live with my wife and two daughters in Chicago&rsquo;s Ukranian Village neighborhood where we participate in a local community garden and make plans to escape Chicago&rsquo;s winter whenever possible.</p>

              <p>You can also find me to some degree or another on the usual networks:</p>
