	<div class="post-content"><p>After a long time of plodding along, doing a bit here and a bit there,
I’ve finally got the beginnings of a <a href="http://vinniefm.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> ready for viewing here.
It’s only demonstrating two of my projects from Cars.com right and I’ll
have another example application from Echo posted shortly. </p>

<p>Given that most of my career has been spent designing SaaS and
enterprise applications, it’s difficult to put up a portfolio. One
aspect of that difficulty is in sharing secure applications. All
examples posted currently are pretty straightforward and obvious though so I
don’t think I’m giving away the farm, so to speak.</p>

<p>The second difficulty lies in the search for minimum viable product (MVP) and the nature of <em>UX Design</em>, particularly in the enterprise space. As will be seen when I post the Echo portfolio piece, it’s a pretty standard quoting workflow. Could we have designed the application as a single page vs. the multi-page, search then result, workflow? Certainly. It would be optimal, in fact. But, as always, other concerns in software development must be balanced. While discussing the single page app concept with the engineering team, it was determined that the release timeline would be greatly extended. That trade-off was unacceptable to the business and thus we ended up with the design we have. That’s not an excuse. It just is what it is. Pragmatism is key as is dedication to the backlog. So, single page application is coming up but not yet designed and implemented.</p>

<p>So, next up here, add the Echo portfolio piece and post the official
resume here. Oh, and sadly, with the release of the portfolio, I’ve got
all kinds of bugs in my CSS impacting site responsiveness so
unfortunately viewing any of this site on a phone sucks at the moment.
Fixes coming for that in short order.</p>
